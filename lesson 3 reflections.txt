1)
Topic:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Duh 0:  Lesson says that if I am working from another computer that does not have the local repository set up, 
I may make an update directly on a remote.

2)
Topic:  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Duh 0:  If you work with other people on a same file or set of files that are dependent on them,
automatic update might overwrite my changes before I am done.  Also, if I have checked out previous
commits, automatic update would break the commits, I'm not sure, but I will probably learn more about this type of scenarios.

3)
Topic:  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Duh 0: Forks are GitHub tool that makes a clone of another repository on the GitHub server.
Clones are a copy of repository that can exist locally or one on GitHub and one on local machine.
Branches are created from the master which can have changes in itself without affecting the master branch for separatly 
experimenting bigger changes and new features.  You have to switch to a particular branch on local to work on it by "git checkout
 <<branch name here...>>.  In order to add the changes in branch, you merge into master, and resolve all conflicts.
